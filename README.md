Other sections: Each section corresponds to a specific type of protection measure, such as anti-spectate, anti-invisible, anti-plate changer, etc.
Overall, this script defines a comprehensive set of configurations for a server protection system with various safeguards against cheating or exploiting in FiveM and can be updated and implemented to your server to fit your configurations or standards - enjoy.

```

### LOGS

```
Based on the code snippet I provided, here are a few other aspects you may need to consider:

Log Levels: The code I shared sets the log level to INFO. However, you may want to adjust the log level based on your requirements. 
The available log levels in increasing order of severity are DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL. You can set the desired log level by modifying the line logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO).

Log Formatting: The code uses a basic log formatting, which includes the log level, timestamp, and message. If you want to customize the log format further, you can modify the logging.basicConfig call by specifying a different format parameter. You can refer to the Python documentation for the logging module to explore various formatting options.

File Handler: The code provided only logs the messages to the console. If you want to log the messages to a file, you can add a FileHandler to the logger. This will allow you to store the logs in a file for future reference. Here's an example of how you can add a file handler:
```
```python 
file_handler = logging.FileHandler('log_file.txt')
file_handler.setLevel(logging.INFO)
file_handler.setFormatter(formatter)
logger.addHandler(file_handler)
```
> Exception Handling: This code includes the calculate_sum, read_file, and write_file functions, along with the exception handling for each operation. It also demonstrates example usages of the functions and logs the results using the logger.
Remember to replace the file names and customize the file operations inside the functions according to your specific requirements.

### DISCORD LOGGING :

> To integrate the Discord logging, you need to update the following sections of the code:

```
Replace "YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN" with your actual Discord bot token in the line client.run("YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN").
Replace 123456789 with the ID of the channel where you want to send the logs in the line channel_id = 123456789.
```

### UPDATES:

> - Updated exception handling format to try-except blocks to implement MORE ROBUST ERROR handling for the ANTICHEAT.

> - ADDED DISCORD INTEGRATION/AUDIT LOG INTEGRATIONS

> - Server-Side Checks: Perform validation and verification of critical actions and data on the server-side. 
For example, when a player performs an action, validate it on the server to ensure it's legitimate and within the allowed parameters.

> - Cleaned up syntax/coding

### WORK IN PROGRESS:

> - Implement Player Behavior Analysis: Instead of solely relying on detecting specific cheat behaviors or actions, I will develop a function that will analyze player behavior patterns over time. 
This can involve tracking player statistics, monitoring player movement and interactions, and detecting anomalies or suspicious patterns. 
By analyzing player behavior, you can identify potential cheaters even if they are using less obvious or undetectable cheats.

> - IMPLEMENT MACHINE LEARNING + DATA PROCESSING:  train a machine learning model using labeled data to classify cheating behaviors and then use the model to detect similar patterns in real-time gameplay. 

> - Encryption and Code Obfuscation - after I have developed this to suit my needs with PBA and Machine Learning - the open source will no longer be available and there will only be a config.lua available for modification. 
Please enjoy this or use it while it last. I will be configuring my obfuscation near the end of this project for a certain areas to protect special parts of algorithims/codes/and unique handlers I have created that run specific functions to provide extra security and maintenance.

> - KEEP ADDING+UPDATING ADDITIONAL CHECK FUNCTIONS

> - SELF MODERATED LOGGING SYSTEM 

> - Throttling + RATE LIMITING ALGORITHIMS 

> - This is an ongoing-open source development made by @KEYS. Feel free to update and contribute as needed to update or FORK TO fit your server preferences.

> - NOTE: the code provided above assumes you are using the FiveM based framework with all the proper dependencies evolved as a base and have the necessary knowledge and understanding of Lua, Python, and FiveM development to implement the AntiCheat features effectively. I will keep updating this eventually as time goes on to be more effecient and protective yet easy to use with FIVEM.


### AI DETECTION/AI MODERATION COMING SOON. ARCH DETECTION/x64/x32 + FILES COMING SOON! 

-- KEYS AC HAS NOT BEEN UPDATED IN AROUND 2 YEARS. IT WILL STILL PROVIDE BASIC ANTTICHEAT PROTECTION WITHIN FIVEM SERVER ENVIRONMENTS BUT WILL NOT STOP MORE MODERN SIGNATURES OF EULEN/REDENGINE/AND ANY TROLL MENUS (DOS OF CROWN)

with a bit of updates and a few pushes. This script will be working better than it did the first time!

If anyone is interested in building different ANTICHEATS FIVEM SPECIFIC please feel free to reach out to me. I  would really love to take this concept and ACTUALLY build out a great ANTICHEAT for FIVEM using real time detection systemss/sepcial logging/error logging etc. TOO MUCH TO TYPE.
